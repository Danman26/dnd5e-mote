# Esterfell Accord

The **Esterfell Accord** is a nation in [Lenya](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/lenya.md). This country was formed from an alliance of multiple progenitor tribes, which were mostly insular cultural groups prior to the alliance. By uniting under a common banner, the Accord was able to increase its power and influence while strengthening its hold on the [Esterfell Sea](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md) and the [Murexian Grove](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/murexian-grove.md), locations of great strategic importance due to the rare natural resources they contain.
