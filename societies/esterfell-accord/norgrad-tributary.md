# Norgrad Tributary

**Norgrad Tributary** is an artificial river that feeds from the oceans north of [Esterfell](../../mote/esterfell/esterfell.md) into the [Esterfell Sea](../../mote/esterfell/esterfell-sea/esterfell-sea.md). The flow of water is controlled by a dam and levee operated by the city of [Norgrad](norgrad.md).
