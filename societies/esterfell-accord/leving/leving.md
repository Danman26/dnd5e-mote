# Leving

**Leving** is a city on the eastern edge of [Middlestag Forest](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/middlestag-forest). It marks an intersection of the [Road of Commerce](../road-of-commerce.md) and connecting roads to [Salkinar](../salkinar.md) and [Brier Glen](../brier-glen.md), and is thus frequented by travelers and merchants moving between the settlements to the south of the [Esterfell Sea](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/esterfell-sea).
