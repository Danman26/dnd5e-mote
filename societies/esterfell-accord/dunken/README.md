# Dunken

**Dunken** is a small town to the west of the [Floral Divide](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/floral-divide) and south of [Frostenfeld](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/frostenfeld). It is currently considered part of the [Esterfell Accord](../), but the region has switched hands numerous times over the centuries and was under control of [Subros](../../subros) until a few decades ago.
