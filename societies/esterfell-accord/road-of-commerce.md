# Road of Commerce

The **Road of Commerce**, also known as "The Main Road" in most regions, is a trade route that circumnavigates the [Esterfell Sea](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/esterfell-sea) and connects most major settlements of the [Esterfell Accord](esterfell-accord.md). The road is considered the primary method of movement between Accord cities by land. It forms an unbroken passage around the Esterfell Sea, even extending across the western stretch of the Sea and [Cassiopeia Island](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/esterfell-sea/cassiopeia-island) via the Bridge of Commerce, and directly over the deepest point of the [Great Seam](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/great-seam) via the city of [Overseam](overseam.md).
