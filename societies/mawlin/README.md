# Mawlin

**Mawlin** is a territory covering most of the island of [Barria](../../mote/esterfell/barria). It has few standing settlements, instead consisting of multiple nomadic tribes that traverse the desert. These tribes maintain an uneasy coexistence with the territory of [Ramila](../ramila).

## Demographics

The Mawlin tribes consist largely of species adapted to persist or thrive within the hot arid climate of Barria, including the following:

- Dragonborn (red and blue)
- [Desert dwarf](../../species/dwarf.md#desert-dwarf)
- Genasi (fire and earth)
- [Dust gnome](../../species/gnome.md#dust-gnome)
- Lizardfolk
- Loxodon
- Thri-kreen
- Tiefling

But prior ancestry is not a strict requirement of living with the Mawlin, and many wanderers from across [Esterfell](../../mote/esterfell) might find themselves adopted into the tribes, including humans banished by [The Chosen](../../organizations/the-chosen) and left to fend for themselves in the harsh stretches of deserts.
