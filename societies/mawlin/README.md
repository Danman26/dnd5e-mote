# Mawlin

**Mawlin** is a territory covering most of the island of [Barria](../../mote/esterfell/barria). It has few standing settlements, instead consisting of multiple nomadic tribes that traverse the desert. These tribes maintain an uneasy coexistence with the territory of [Ramila](../ramila).

## Demographics

The Mawlin tribes consist largely of species adapted to persist or thrive within the hot arid climate of Barria, including blue and red dragonborn, lizardfolk, loxodons, thri-kreen, and tieflings. But this is not a hard requirement of living with the Mawlin, and many wanderers from across [Esterfell](../../mote/esterfell) might find themselves adopted into the tribes, including humans banished by Ramila and left to fend for themselves in the harsh stretches of deserts.
