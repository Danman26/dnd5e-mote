# Verdancy

The **Verdancy** is broadly defined as any region of land not considered to be under the control of the [Esterfell Accord](../esterfell-accord) or [Subros](../subros). This "unincorporated" territory is technically occupied by many geopolitical groups and tribes flying different banners and organized under various nations, but the governance of these groups is not recognized by either larger nation. Territory constituting the Verdancy includes the islands of [Malagwa](../../geography/esterfell/malagwa) and [Barria](../../geography/esterfell/barria), the [Ashen Archipelago](../../geography/esterfell/ashen-archipelago), and a large stretch of [Lenya](../../geography/esterfell/lenya) dividing the territories of the Accord and Subros, broadly marked by the [Floral Divide](../../geography/esterfell/lenya/floral-divide) and the southern stretch of the [Great Seam](../../geography/esterfell/lenya/great-seam).
