## History

Mírial traveled to [Edgewood](../../esterfell-accord/edgewood/edgewood.md) and joined forces with [Alyseris](../../esterfell-accord/citizenry/alyseris.md), [Jedha](../../esterfell-accord/citizenry/jedha.md), [Kalista](../../../organizations/reynards-den/members/kalista.md), and [Riordan](../../esterfell-accord/citizenry/riordan.md) to track down a missing acolyte named [Adelia](../../../organizations/order-of-istus/members/adelia.md), eventually discovering that she was kidnapped by goblins, in league with former acolyte [Gren](../../../organizations/order-of-istus/members/gren.md), as part of a larger plot to steal her [blessing of foresight](../../../supernatural-gifts/blessing-of-foresight.md) granted to her by [Istus](../../../pantheon/istus.md). During their rescue mission, the gift of foresight was transferred from Adelia to Mírial, and though this divine connection Istus continues to guide her with vague visions of events to come.

While departing Edgewood to deliver Gren to prison in [Leving](../../esterfell-accord/leving/leving.md), the group joined forces with [Alden Vacker](alden-vacker.md) and [Rowan Dundragon](../../esterfell-accord/citizenry/rowan-dundragon.md). The party was jumped on the road to Leving by the [Gilded Purse](../../../organizations/gilded-purse/gilded-purse.md) gang who tried to rob them, but the gang was quickly beat down and retreated while the sounds of wolf howls filled the air. [Rob Tealeaf](../../../organiations/gilded-purse/members/rob-tealeaf.md), feeling guilt over this involvement in the plot, appealed to the party and they accepted him amongst their ranks while navigating the dangerous woods that encroached on the [Road of Commerce](../../esterfell-accord/road-of-commerce.md).
