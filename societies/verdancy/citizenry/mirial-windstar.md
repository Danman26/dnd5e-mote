## History

Mírial traveled to [Edgewood](../../esterfell-accord/edgewood/edgewood.md) and joined forces with [Alyseris](../../esterfell-accord/citizenry/alyseris.md), [Jedha](../../esterfell-accord/citizenry/jedha.md), [Kalista](../../../organizations/reynards-den/members/kalista.md), and [Riordan](../../esterfell-accord/citizenry/riordan.md) to track down a missing acolyte named [Adelia](../../../organizations/order-of-istus/members/adelia.md). The group discovered that Adelia was kidnapped by goblins, aided by former acolyte [Gren](../../../organizations/order-of-istus/members/gren.md) as part of a larger plot to steal her [blessing of foresight](../../../supernatural-gifts/blessing-of-foresight.md) granted to her by [Istus](../../../pantheon/istus.md). During their rescue mission, the gift of foresight was transferred from Adelia to Mírial, and though this divine connection Istus continues to guide her with vague visions of events to come.
