# Xiahulia

**Xiahulia** is an ocean nation occupying the island of [Malagwa](../../mote/esterfell/malagwa) and the continental shelf along the northern shore of [Lenya](../../mote/esterfell/lenya). It is populated entirely by water-breathing societies, including merfolk, triton, and selkie tribes.
