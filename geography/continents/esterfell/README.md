# Esterfell

**Esterfell** is a continent consisting of multiple islands.

## History

### Formation

### Starstuff impact

Though Esterfell hosted a diverse ecosystem for millions of years, awakened beings and the discovery of magic were unknown to the continent until the last few thousand years.

### Settlement

As the motequakes of Esterfell's impact slowly settled, various societies were drawn by the magical pull of the massive deposit of starstuff left behind. These people traveled thousands of miles across empty stretches of ocean, braving treacherous conditions in unsettled seas, suffering many losses, all in the hope of a better life through the bounty of magic and prosperity that such starstuff might provide.

Every group that arrived on Esterfell's shores all those generations ago quickly found land that appealed to their existing sensibilities and climate tolerances; boreal folk gathered in the taiga of the [Kari Outskirts](../../geography/continents/esterfell/lenya/kari-outskirts), aquatic societies took to the oceans around Malagwa, people attuned to the elements of earth and fire settled into the otherwise hostile heat and volcanic ash of [Mount Hora](../../geography/continents/esterfell/lenya/mount-hora), and so on in that manner. This created a wide distribution of people from many different cultural, genetic, elemental, and planar origins.
