# Needle Canyon

**Needle Canyon** is a gap between the peaks of the [Attalya Mountains](../attalya-mountains). Its rocky terrain makes the region mostly unsuitable for land development, but the small town of [Needledale](../../../../../societies/esterfell-accord/needledale) marks the canyon's eastern entrance.
