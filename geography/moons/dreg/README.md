# Dreg

**Dreg** is the smallest moon of Mote and is also its closest orbiting natural satellite. The moon acts as a final layer of protection from freefalling starstuff that gets past [Kiva](../kiva) and [Bathýs-Pela](bathýs-pela) on its way to Mote. Dreg has a dark nonreflective surface that can sometimes make it difficult to see from Mote's surface, although it briefly emits erratic flashes of light during larger starstuff collisions.

## Attributes

- Orbital period: 1.5 months

## History

### Etymology

The moon's name comes from the Common word "dregs" meaning "remnants". This title refers to Dreg's function as a last line of defense keeping larger starstuff asteroids from colliding with Mote, and is also used to describe [the material](../../../lore/dreg-ore) that primarily composes the moon's surface.

## Materials

Dreg's main material composition is a mineral that shares its name with the moon itself. This substance has the unique ability to both negate the magical properties of any starstuff that comes into contact and to convert it into more dreg.
