# Tealeaf Estate

The **Tealeaf Estate** is a highly successful family-run business operating out of [Brier Glen](../societies/esterfell-accord/brier-glen.md). The Tealeaf family specializes in the cultivation of tea, a plant that grows natively in [Yggru](../mote/esterfell/yggru) but was only introduced to [Lenya](../mote/esterfell/lenya) in the last century by the Tealeaves.
