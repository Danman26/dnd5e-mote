# Antipelan Society

The **Antipelan Society** is a secretive organization operating off of the northern coast of [Lenya](../../mote/esterfell/lenya) dedicated to the acquisition of [starstuff](../../artifacts/starstuff) found floating freely in [Fellspace](../../astronomy/fellspace). The Antipelans are currently the only group on [Mote](../../mote) who have developed spelljamming technology, and they hope to use this advantage to gain political and military control over Fellspace ahead of any other societies on the planet, and before any outside spacefaring powers encroach on the territory.

## History

The Antipelans were formed as a secretive cabal of wealthy individuals seeking to increase their own power and influence by taking to the stars as the next frontier of exploration. Employing the brightest technical and arcane minds they could find on [Esterfell](../../mote/esterfell), they used their outsized wealth and access to precious starstuff to jumpstart the development of spelljamming technology. The result was the [starfire ship](../../technology/starstuff-ships/starfire-ship), an experimental technology that used starstuff as an exotic magical fuel to allow great bursts of speed and powerful arcane weaponry.

To ensure the secrecy of their efforts, a base of operations was established beyond Lenya's continental shelf, on a small rocky outcropping in the middle of the ocean. Powerful illusion magic conceals the Antipelan base from divination or perception, making it appear to be open ocean. Any outsider on a direct course to the island is subtly redirected around it through the manipulation of local currents and wind.

Behind this illusory cloak, a space elevator extends from the island's surface out beyond Mote's atmosphere, allowing for launches into Fellspace without the use of powerful rocket propulsion or high-level evocation magic, either of which might draw the attention of the [Accord](../../societies/esterfell-accord). The space elevator acts as a singular central access point for spelljamming ships to move to and from Mote's surface, and the Antipelan Society maintains tight control over this port of entry, disallowing the direct landing of spelljamming ships on the planet itself.

In the other direction, the space elevator extends deep within Mote's crust where the Antipelans maintain their fleet of laboratories for research and development, as well as barracks and housing for numerous staff. Most Antipelan members reside fully within the base, with a scarce few individuals returning to the Accord via [Cape Bec](../../societies/esterfell-accord/cape-bec) as needed to resupply. The crew of the Sanguine Starcatcher is given relatively free reign to move about in Esterfell to carry out their own ship's operations, as long as full secrecy is maintained regarding the Antipelan Society and their spacefaring technology.
