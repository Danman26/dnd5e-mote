# Reynard's Den

**Reynard's Den** is a cartel operating out of several cities in the [Esterfell Accord](../../societies/esterfell-accord). Its main business comes from smuggling stolen teas out of [Brier Glen](../../societies/esterfell-accord/brier-glen) to sell on the black market in [Leving](../../societies/esterfell-accord/leving) and [Overseam](../../societies/esterfell-accord/overseam), but the organization has agents secretly furthering its financial and political efforts throughout the Accord.

## Communication

Den agents use a variety of channels for communication to allow quick conveyance of messages in a discreet manner. Where magical messaging is not available, courier animals are often employed, sent through a communications officer to relay to and from each recipient. Regardless of how a message is sent, simple code name substitutions are used in place of Den member and location names. These names tend to be associated with avian creatures of similar name structure. The following place name substitutions have been observed in Den communiques:

- [Leving](../../societies/esterfell-accord/leving): Lyre
- [Needledale](../../societies/esterfell-accord/needledale): Dodo's Nest
-
