# Shorsta-Halasma

The **Shorsta-Halasma** are an order of monks endeavoring to unlock the secrets of planar psionics. Each teacher and student learns to mentally connect to a specific realm, then channels that planar energy through their ki using a [staff of Shorsta](../../artifacts/staff-of-shorsta.md). Their monastery is hidden deep within the [Eastern Forests](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/eastern-forests.md).
