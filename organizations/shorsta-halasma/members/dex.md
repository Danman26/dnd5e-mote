## History

Dex excelled in his studies at the Shorsta-Halasma monastery in the ways of shadow and stealth, though his rebellious streak often got him in trouble. He believed that this ultimately led to him being kicked out of the monastery, though the true nature of his departure was not revealed to him at that time.
