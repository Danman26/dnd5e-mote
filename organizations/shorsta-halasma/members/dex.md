## History

### Childhood

From an early age, Dex showed an aptitude for hand-to-hand combat. His family desired to help him hone his skills through mental discipline, so they enrolled him in the Shorsta-Halasma monastery. Dex excelled in his studies in the ways of shadow and stealth, but his rebellious streak often got him in trouble with his teachers. He believed that this ultimately led to him being kicked out of the monastery, though the true nature of his departure was not revealed to him at that time. Because of this apparent expulsion, Dex has not yet completed the construction of his [staff of Shorsta](../../../artifacts/staff-of-shorsta.md).

### Adulthood

While exploring a kobold's den exposed by a quarry in the [Open Fields](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/open-fields.md), a cavern collapse left Dex trapped inside. He was soon discovered by [Alden Vacker](../../../societies/verdancy/citizenry/alden-vacker.md), [Alyseris](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/alyseris.md), [Jedha](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/jedha), [Kalista](../../../organizations/reynards-den/kalista.md), [MÃ­rial Windstar](../../../societies/verdancy/citizenry/mirial-windstar.md), [Riardon](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/riardon.md), [Rob Tealeaf](../../../organizations/gilden-purse/members/rob-tealeaf.md), and [Rowan Dundragon](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/rowan-dundragon.md). After they helped him escape the den, Dex decided to join the adventuring group as they investigated strange occurrences in [Middlestag Forest](../../../mote/esterfell/lenya/middlestag-forest.md).
