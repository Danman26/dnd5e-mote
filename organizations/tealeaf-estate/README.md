# Tealeaf Estate

The **Tealeaf Estate** is a highly successful family-run business operating out of [Brier Glen](../../societier/esterfell-accord/brier-glen). The Tealeaf family specializes in the cultivation of tea, a plant that grows natively in [Yggru](../../mote/esterfell/yggru) but was only introduced to [Lenya](../../mote/esterfell/lenya) in the last century by the Tealeaves.
