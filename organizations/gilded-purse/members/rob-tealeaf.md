## History

Rob and the rest of the Gilded Purse attempted to jump an adventuring party traveling from [Edgewood](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/edgewood/edgewood.md) to [Leving](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/leving/leving.md) via the [Road of Commerce](../../../societies/esterfell-accord/road-of-commerce.md), but felt guilt over his involvement in the escalated cycle of violence perpetuated by the gang leader [Baldwin Marshbluff](baldwin-marshbluff.md) and opted to side with the adventurers instead.
