### Clarity of Istus

To a select few, Istus grants a portion of her power, allowing them the ability to briefly glimpse future events. The most recent recipient of this ability is [Adelia](../../societies/esterfell-accord/citizenry/adelia). Most seers who receive this gift are members of the Order of Istus, but during certain stellar confluences, a _wand of secrets_ can be used as part of a special ceremony to transfer this ability between individuals. Otherwise, the seer retains this gift until death.

#### Description

Istus has blessed you with the ability to tap into the weavings of fate and glimpse future events. This foreknowledge allows you to bend fate slightly, potentially changing the outcome of your personal destiny.

Once per week during a long rest, you receive a prophetic vision of future events affecting you and your party in the form of a dream. Roll on the **Clarity** and **Portent** tables to determine the nature and topic of the vision; the DM relays your vision based on these rolls.

This ability lasts until you die.
