# Phygius

**Phygius** is a cervid creature which oscillates between the Material Plane and the Feywild, but is not able to remain on either plane for long periods. It is the namesake of [Middlestag Forest](../../mote/esterfell/lenya/middlestag-forest), based on rough accounts of its appearance by humanoids who have seen brief glimpses of it throughout history, and it primarily resides within the forest's boundaries across both planes.
