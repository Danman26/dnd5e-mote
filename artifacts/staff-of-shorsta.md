# Staff of Shorsta

#### Attributes

_Weapon (quarterstaff), uncommon (requires attunement by a Shorsta-Halasma monk)_

This quarterstaff is sturdily constructed from a tree branch by a student of the [Shorsta-Halasma](../organizations/shorsta-halasma/shorsta-halasma.md), then inset with a fragment of [starstuff](starstuff.md) to hone the wielder's mental connection with a specific plane of existence.

While attuned to a staff of Shorsta, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and this bonus increases based on your monk level: +2 at 10th level, and +3 at 15th level.
- You gain an additional number of special Discipline Points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). These special Discipline Points can be spent and combined with any Discipline Points you already have from another source. When you spend a special Discipline Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.
- You gain a special feature based on your monk subclass and its corresponding plane of existence:

  - **Warrior of the Ascendant Dragon (Pandemonium).** When you take damage from a melee attack, as a reaction, you can spend 1-3 Discipline Points to deal damage to the attacker equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die per point spent. The damage type is your choice of acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison (choose the damage type each time you use this reaction).
  - **Warrior of the Astral Self (Astral Plane).** When you activate your Arms, Visage, or Body of the Astral Self, you can spend 1-3 additional Discipline Points to increase the duration of these aspects by an additional 10 minutes per point spent, and for the duration of these aspects, all ability checks and saving throws you make using your Wisdom have a +1 bonus per point spent.
  - **Warrior of the Drunken Master (Feywild).** Each time you spend Discipline Points, you regain Hit Points equal to twice the number of Discipline Points spent. If you are at your hit point maximum, these hit points are instead gained as Temporary Hit Points.
  - **Warrior of the Elements (Elemental Planes).** When you deal damage to one or more creatures by using a Magic Action or casting a spell, you can spend 1-3 Discipline Points to deal additional damage to all affected creatures equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die per point spent. The damage type is your choice or acid, cold, fire, or lightning (choose the damage type each time you use this reaction).
  - **Warrior of the Hand (Arcadia).** Your monk features that require spending Discipline Points cost 1 less point (minimum 1 Discipline Point).
  - **Warrior of the Kensei (Ysgard).** Each time you hit with an attack using a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to make that attack ignore damage resistance and immunity.
  - **Warrior of the Long Death (Negative Plane).** Each time you regain Hit Points, gain Temporary Hit Points, or deal necrotic damage using a monk feature, you can spend 1-3 Discipline Points to increase the amount or hit points gained or damage dealt by a number equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die per point spent.
  - **Warror of Mercy (Arborea).** Each time you use your Hand of Healing or Hand of Harm feature, you can spend 1-3 Discipline Points to apply the feature's effect to an additional creature within 30 feet you can see per point spent.
  - **Warrior of Shadow (Shadowfell).** While you are shrouded in darkness, your melee attacks deal additional damage equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die.
  - **Warrior of the Sun Soul (Positive Plane).** Each time you deal fire or radiant damage with an attack, spell, or Magic Action, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to make that attack ignore damage resistance.

- While on the plane of existence corresponding to your monk subclass in the above list, you are considered a native being of that plane, you can choose to be immune to any optional rule that affects creatures visiting that plane, and each time you finish a Long Rest on that plane of existence, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your monk level.

#### Description

As a monk of the Shorsta-Halasma trains in the arts of planar psionics, they eventually gravitate toward a specific plane of existence and use their ki to channel the energies of that plane. This connection is only made possible by constructing a special quarterstaff that aligns these planar energies with the wielder's mind, using a fragment of starstuff to solidify this alignment. The secrets of creating this staff are closely guarded by the Shorsta-Halasma instructors and students, having been passed down for centuries as secrets once discovered by the monastery's founders.
