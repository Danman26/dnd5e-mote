# Eastern Forests

The **Eastern Forests** are a wooded region along the eastern coast of [Lenya](../). The forests extend from the [Ashen Scape](../ashen-scape) and [Great Seam](../great-seam) to the southeastern tip of the continent. These woods are considered to be fully within [Verdancy](../../../../societies/verdancy/verdancy.md) territory and to not be under the rule of the [Esterfell Accord](../../../../societies/esterfell-accord) or [Subros](../../../../societies/subros.md), instead leaving oversight to the individual tribes who call the forest their home.
