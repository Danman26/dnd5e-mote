# Kari Outskirts

The **Kari Outskirts** are combrised of broad prairie lands and tundra south of the [Floral Divide](../floral-divide).

## Settlements

Most of the land known as the Kari Outskirts officially falls under the domain of [Subros](../../../../societies/subros), but much of it remains undeveloped with no permanent Subrosian presence, leaving it to be broadly considered [Verdancy](../../../../societies/verdancy) territory. [Redgrave](../../../../societies/esterfell-accord/redgrave) is only [Esterfell Accord](../../../../societies/esterfell-accord) city in this region.
