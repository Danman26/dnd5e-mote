# Floral Divide

The **Floral Divide** is a mountain range dividing the northern and southern portions of [Lenya](../lenya.md). The mountains mark a natural boundary and border between the [Esterfell Accord](../../../../societies/esterfell-accord/esterfell-accord.md) and [Subros](../../../../societies/subros.md).

## Geography

The mountain range stretches from Lenya's central west coast to the center of the [Great Seam](../great-seam.md) to the east. The Divide consists of seven mountain peaks: 1, 2, 3, [Rokincier](rokincier.md), 5, 6, and 7.

## Demographics

Multiple pockets of people reside in settlements on each of the Floral Divide's seven peaks. These people include the dwarves, gnomes, and earth genasi of [Kolheim](../../../../societies/verdancy/kolheim.md), and the stone giants who wander the central peak of Rokincier. The harsh terrain of each mountain makes it difficult to traverse directly to other peaks in the Divide, but the people will make their way to the range's base to engage in trade with Accord and Subrosian outposts. Those who hail from the Floral Divide are often employed as mountaineering guides by people from the neighboring nations, and will sometimes provide neutral locations for meetings between Subrosian and Accord dignitaries.
