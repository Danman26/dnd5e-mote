# Middlestag Forest

**Middlestag Forest** is a wooded region along the southern coast of the [Esterfell Sea](../esterfell-sea). Several settlements of varying sizes surround the wood, but the forest itself has been left undeveloped by the [Esterfell Accord](../../../../societies/esterfell-accord).

## Geography

The forest spans from the base of [Taltol Peak](../attalya-mountains/taltol-peak) to the [Open Fields](../open-fields).

## Etymology

Middlestag is named after a [mythical buck](../../../../pantheon/phygius) with three antlers that supposedly watches over the forest, acting as its protector against the encroachment of civilization.
