# Esterfell

**Esterfell** is a continent consisting of multiple islands.

## History

### Starstuff impact

Several thousand years ago, the then-unnamed continent was subjected to a massive impact by an asteroid composed entirely of [starstuff](../../lore/starstuff). The impact rocked the landscape, rapidly reshaping the continent as stellar energies surged through the mountains and forests, and triggering volcanic eruptions and motequakes that even shook the opposite end of the globe. These quakes ripped apart the continent into a smaller set of islands. Much flora and fauna was killed instantly at the impact site on [Lenya](lenya), while survivors within thousands of miles were infused with starstuff fragments empowering their bodies with magical essence and jumpstarting strange evolutionary processes. The asteroid punched deep into Mote's crust, exposing ancient aquifers that rapidly filled the crater and created a new [inland sea](lenya/esterfell-sea).

### Settlement

Though Esterfell hosted a diverse ecosystem for millions of years, awakened beings and the discovery of magic were unknown to the continent until the last few millennia. As the motequakes of Esterfell's impact slowly settled, various societies were drawn by the magical pull of the massive deposit of starstuff left behind. These people traveled thousands of miles across empty stretches of ocean, braving treacherous conditions in unsettled seas, suffering many losses, all in the hope of a better life through the bounty of magic and prosperity that such starstuff might provide.

Every group that arrived on Esterfell's shores all those generations ago quickly found land that appealed to their existing sensibilities and climate tolerances; boreal folk gathered in the taiga of the [Kari Outskirts](lenya/kari-outskirts), aquatic societies took to the oceans around [Malagwa](malagwa), people attuned to the element of fire settled into the otherwise hostile heat and volcanic ash of [Mount Hora](lenya/mount-hora), and so on in that manner. This created a wide distribution of people from many different cultural, genetic, elemental, and planar origins.
