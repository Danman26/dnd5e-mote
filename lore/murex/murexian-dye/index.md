# Murexian Dye

**Murexian dye** is a compound derived from [murex](../) that can be used to add a vibrant iridescent purple coloration to textiles, metals, and other materials. The difficulty in obtaining and converting murex makes murexian-dyed materials highly valuable, and the supply chain of the dyes themselves is under tight [Accord](../../../societies/esterfell-accord) control.

## Manufacturing process

A vial of pure murex can be processed with alchemist's supplies into 5 vials of dye with a successful DC 20 Intelligence check. On a failure, the compound explodes from the vial and deals 1d4 poison damage to the user.
